- **Environment Detection**: Centralized environment detection using `EnvironmentHelper` to reduce code duplication
- **Caching System**: Implemented static caching for environment methods with 7x performance improvement
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Clean PHPUnit exit codes (0) for better CI/CD integration

#### 🌐 **Added**
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Added platform-specific scripts for test coverage
  - `scripts/test-coverage.sh` for Unix/Linux/macOS
  - `scripts/test-coverage.bat` for Windows CMD
  - `scripts/test-coverage.ps1` for PowerShell
  - `scripts/test-coverage.php` for universal PHP-based execution
- **Cache Management**: Added `EnvironmentHelper::clearCache()` method for testing scenarios
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Added benchmark scripts to demonstrate caching benefits

#### 🔧 **Fixed**
- **CI/CD Compatibility**: Fixed PHPUnit exit codes that were causing CI failures
- **Log Pollution**: Suppressed test-specific error logs in testing environment
- **PSR-12 Compliance**: Fixed all code style violations
- **Cross-Platform Issues**: Resolved Windows compatibility issues with inline environment variables

#### 🏗️ **Refactored**
